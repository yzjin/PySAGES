# Getting Started

PySAGES is designed to seamlessly integrate with your existing simulations.
For an easy start, we prepared examples in Google Colab notebooks, which provide
access to a working simulation environment and GPU hardware.
For example, you can use PySAGES with HOOMD-blue to run a simple [umbrella sampling
simulation][HOOMD Notebook].
Or, you can use PySAGES with OpenMM to explore the free energy landscape of the
conformational space of alanine dipeptide via [harmonic biasing][OpenMM Notebook].
Using the notebooks enables you to get started with PySAGES without any installation.
However, for a more productive deployment, we recommend a local installation instead.

We offer more examples, in the form of both Google Colab notebooks and scripts, for locally
installed PySAGES in the [examples path][Examples URL] within the GitHub repository.
